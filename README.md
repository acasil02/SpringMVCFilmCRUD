# SpringMVCFilmCRUD


##Developer(Devan)'s Log

This project is very interesting and a test more skills to work together rather than
overall knowledge. Having the ability to work and see others work helps me to make changes and think of things I didn't know before.
The Debug tool is really helpful to help challenge the assumptions that are made to help work through the difficulties.

##Developer(Angel)'s Log

This project was a way to be able to find, list, create, update films on a data base while displaying all information. This was a great way to be able to learn how to work on a team setting and how to plan out with others while getting help from one another. The challenge for me was on how to get the correct paths with the files along with setting correct methods to be able to run the program.
