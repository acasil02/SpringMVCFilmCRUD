##Developer(Devan)'s Log

This project is very interesting and a test more skills to work together rather than
overall knowledge. Having the ability to work and see others work helps me to make changes and think of things I didn't know before.
The Debug tool is really helpful to help challenge the assumptions that are made to help work through the difficulties.
